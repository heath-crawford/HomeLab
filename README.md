## 🛠️ Overview  
**You are what you think—so I’m thinking about security.**  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This repo is where I document my journey into cybersecurity and homelab security. It started as a way for me to actually *retain* what I was reading and watching—because let’s be honest, just consuming information doesn’t mean you *understand* it. Instead of following someone else’s guide and getting frustrated when things didn’t work, I decided to build my own security-first homelab from scratch.  

The goal? **To create a functional, secure, and professional-grade homelab while truly understanding how everything works.** I’m treating this project like a security professional would, documenting best practices, solving problems, and refining my setup along the way.  

This isn’t just about getting things to work—it’s about making them work **securely** and **learning from every challenge** that comes up. Most of the time, things *don’t* work right away (if you know, you know), but that’s part of the process.  

### 🔥 Why This Project?  
- I never felt like I was learning as much as I *could*—or more importantly, as much as I *wanted*.  
- This homelab forces me to think critically, solve problems, and actually retain knowledge instead of just consuming it.  
- I’ve tried following other guides in the past, but I always hit roadblocks. Instead of getting discouraged, I’m building my own approach and documenting it.  
- ChatGPT helps me think through problems and document my progress—turning this into a useful resource for myself (and maybe others).  

### 🎯 What Makes This Unique?  
- **Security-first approach** – Many homelabs focus on IT infrastructure; mine is built from the ground up with security in mind.  
- **Professional mindset** – I want this to look like something an enterprise could use one day. It might not always *look* professional, but that’s the goal.  
- **Trial by fire** – I’m not just spinning up tools; I’m learning how they work and breaking them (on purpose) to understand them better.  

### 💡 Who Is This For?  
Right now, this is mostly for me. But if you’re into homelabs, security, or automation, you might find some value here. If you have questions, feel free to ask—I’ll answer when I’m not yelling at firewall rules.
